# Install

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `^`.

```
composer require christoph-kluge/reactphp-http-response-compression-middleware
```

This middleware will detect if the request is compressible and will compress the response body and add relevant headers to it.

# Usage

```php
$server = new Server(new MiddlewareRunner([
    new ResponseCompressionMiddleware([
        new CompressionGzipHandler(),
        new CompressionDeflateHandler(),
    ]),
    function (ServerRequestInterface $request, callable $next) {
        return new Response(200, ['Content-Type' => 'application/json'], json_encode([
            'some' => 'nice',
            'json' => 'values',
        ]));
    },
]));
```
